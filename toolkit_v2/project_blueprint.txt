Concept: Create a program that fills the following functions:
	1. Syntax reference guide for the Terminal, Git, and Python
	2. Reference guide for general concepts, acting as REPL notebook while progressing through the LauncSchool Course

- Ask user what language/area they need to reference (Terminal, Git, Python, etc.)
	- Take user input
	- Ask user input if they want to reference syntax or review concepts
	- Take User input
	- Direct user to
START

def terminate_program():
	- checks if user input is '0' and terminates program if true

def check_user_input():
	- verifys the user input is valid and gives the user the opportunity to reattempt input (calls terminate_program function)

def display_list_selection_choices(list):
	-iterate through a list and print each item with a corresponding number

SET topic_list = [Terminal, Git, Python]

PRINT display_list_selection_choices(topic_list)
GET check_user_input(input)
IF input is in topic list:
